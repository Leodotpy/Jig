## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security issue:

1. **Email** the maintainers (see repository contacts) or open a **private security advisory** on GitHub: *Repository → Security → Advisories → New draft*.
2. Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact.
3. We will acknowledge within a reasonable time and work on a fix.
4. Do not disclose the issue publicly until we have addressed it or agreed on a disclosure timeline.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters (with permission) in release notes.
